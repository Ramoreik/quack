# Quack ?
Little script to stylize output in simple scripts
I will use this to write exploits and have clean output when doing so

# Main
- Allow to start a spinner for a given fn
- Print Title with choice of style and color
- Print sub-titles with choice of style and color
- Get user input and passwd using stylized prompts

# Design
- Try to put everything in JSON files
- Make every function easily callable
